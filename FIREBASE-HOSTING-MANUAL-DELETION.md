# Firebase Hosting Manual Deletion Guide

## Important Notice

We have successfully disabled Firebase hosting through the command line, but to completely delete it, you need to follow these manual steps in the Firebase Console.

## Step-by-Step Guide with Screenshots

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console

Open your browser and navigate to the Firebase Console:
[https://console.firebase.google.com/project/money-transfering/hosting/sites](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/money-transfering/hosting/sites)

### Step 2: Select Your Hosting Site

You should see your site (money-transfering.web.app) in the list:

```
+-----------------------------+
| Firebase Hosting            |
+-----------------------------+
|                             |
| money-transfering.web.app   | ... [three dots menu] ⋮
|  ↳ Currently disabled       |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+
```

### Step 3: Open the Three Dots Menu and Delete

1. Click on the three dots menu (⋮) on the right side of your hosting site
2. Select "Delete site" from the dropdown menu:

```
+-----------------------------+
| ⋮ ↓                         |
|   +---------------------+   |
|   | View site           |   |
|   | Site settings       |   |
|   | Delete site  ←      |   |
|   +---------------------+   |
+-----------------------------+
```

### Step 4: Confirm Deletion

You'll be asked to confirm by typing the site name:

```
+-----------------------------+
| Delete site                 |
+-----------------------------+
| This will permanently       |
| delete your hosting site.   |
| This action cannot be       |
| undone.                     |
|                             |
| Type money-transfering to   |
| confirm:                    |
|                             |
| [________________]          |
|                             |
| [Cancel]    [Delete]        |
+-----------------------------+
```

Type `money-transfering` and click the "Delete" button.

### Step 5: Verify Deletion

After deletion, you should no longer see the site listed in your Firebase Hosting section. To double-check, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
firebase hosting:sites:list --project money-transfering
```

If the deletion was successful, the list should either be empty or the specific site should no longer appear.

## Completion

Once you've completed these steps, Firebase hosting will be completely deleted from your project. 

You can verify this by:

1. Trying to access your site URL (https://money-transfering.web.app), which should now return a 404 or "Site not found" error
2. Checking the Firebase Console hosting section, which should no longer list your site

## Next Steps

If you want to completely remove Firebase from your project:

1. Delete any remaining Firebase configuration from your local project files
2. Consider removing the Firebase project entirely from the Firebase Console if you no longer need any Firebase services
